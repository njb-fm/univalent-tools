## About this
Well, what's this??? To put it simply, it's a system configuration software that works with Bash and so on.
Inspired by the i3-wm version of Alter Linux, I thought, "I wish I had something like this."

This script can do:
- Network Setting (Network Manager Connection Editor)
- Display Setting (ARandR)
- Audio Setting (Pavucontrol{,-Qt})
- Package Management (Pamac)

## Dependencies
- nm-connection-editor
- pavucontrol / pavucontrol-qt
- pamac-aur (or pamac-*)

## Special Thanks
